Banking Sim Monorepo

This repository is a monorepo for the Banking Sim project. It contains several interrelated packages that simulate various components of a banking system. The project is managed using Lerna, which helps coordinate package versions and dependencies across the repository.

Overview

The monorepo includes the following packages:

admin-api: An API for bank tellers (administrators) that uses classic user/password authentication. It provides endpoints for managing customers, accounts, transactions, and database operations.
psd2-api: An API for PSD2-compliant operations aimed at Third-Party Providers (TPPs). This service includes endpoints for account and transaction information, and it verifies both authentication and customer consent.
auth-service: Provides authentication services (e.g., token verification, role, and scope checks) used by other packages.
common: Contains shared types, enums, and API clients (e.g., for account, customer, consent, and transaction operations) used across the project.
core-banking: Simulates core banking functionality, which may be integrated into the other services as needed.
Additionally, the scripts directory contains utilities for setting up demos, starting services, and testing the system.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-org/banking-sim.git
cd banking-sim
Install dependencies:
Since this is a monorepo managed by Lerna, run:

npm install
npm run build
This installs all dependencies for each package and links local packages together.
Running the Project

The repository includes several scripts for running and testing the system:

Start All Services:
Use the provided script to start all services at once:

npm run start-all
Start a Specific Service:
You can also start a specific service, for example, the Admin API:

npm run start-bank
Or the PSD2 API:

npm run start-tpp
Setup and Test:
Additional scripts (e.g., setup-demo.ts and test-setup.ts) are available for setting up demo data or running tests.
Development

Common Package:
Contains shared types (e.g., ICustomer, IAccount, IConsent, ITransaction) and API clients for various modules. This package is used across both the admin and PSD2 APIs.
Authentication:
The auth-service package handles token verification, role checks, and scope validations. Both the Admin API and PSD2 API use these middlewares to secure endpoints.
Consent Verification in PSD2 API:
The PSD2 API uses a custom middleware (verifyConsent) to ensure that customer consent is valid and includes the necessary permissions for the requested operations.
