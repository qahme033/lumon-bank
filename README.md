# Banking Sim Monorepo

This monorepo contains all the packages for the Banking Sim project, which simulates a complete banking system. The project is managed using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to handle inter-package dependencies and versioning.

## Overview

The repository includes the following packages:

- **admin-api**: API for bank teller operations using classic user/password authentication.
- **psd2-api**: API for PSD2-compliant operations that include token authentication and customer consent verification.
- **auth-service**: Authentication utilities (e.g., token verification, role & scope checks).
- **common**: Shared types, enums, and API clients (accounts, customers, consents, transactions, etc.).
- **core-banking**: Core banking functionality.
- **scripts**: Utility scripts for setting up demos, starting services, and testing.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-org/banking-sim.git
cd banking-sim
Install dependencies:
Since this is a monorepo managed by Lerna, run:

npm install
npm run build
```

The repository includes several scripts for running and testing the system:

Start All Services:
Use the provided script to start all services at once:

npm run start-all
Start a Specific Service:
You can also start a specific service, for example, the Admin API:

npm run start-bank
Or the PSD2 API:

npm run start-tpp
Setup and Test:
Additional scripts (e.g., setup-demo.ts and test-setup.ts) are available for setting up demo data or running tests.
Development

Common Package:
Contains shared types (e.g., ICustomer, IAccount, IConsent, ITransaction) and API clients for various modules. This package is used across both the admin and PSD2 APIs.
Authentication:
The auth-service package handles token verification, role checks, and scope validations. Both the Admin API and PSD2 API use these middlewares to secure endpoints.
Consent Verification in PSD2 API:
The PSD2 API uses a custom middleware (verifyConsent) to ensure that customer consent is valid and includes the necessary permissions for the requested operations.
